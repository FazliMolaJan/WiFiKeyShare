title: Write it to an NFC tag
description: |
---
  Push the button, and scan an NFC tag to write the Wi-Fi configuration to it.

  The tag will be natively supported by Android 5.0 and more, so your friends
  won't have to download any specific app to connect to the network after
  scanning the tag. Devices running an older version of Android will have to
  install WiFiKeyShare for the tag to be supported.

  Bonus tip: approach two devices back to back, and you will be able to share
  the password with Android Beam.
