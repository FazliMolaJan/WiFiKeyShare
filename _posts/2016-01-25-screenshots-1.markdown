  When you open the app, your saved Wi-Fi networks will be listed along with
  their corresponding security. The logo on the right tells you if the app has
  the password. If your device is not rooted, it will be asked the first time
  you select a network.

  You can view or clear the saved password with a long-tap on a network.
