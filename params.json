That means people running Android 5.0+ won't have to download any specific app\r\nto connect to the network after scanning the tag.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nAndroid does not let apps read the saved Wi-Fi passwords, so the user will need the enter them\r\nmanually for each network. However, the passwords will automatically be retrieved if WiFiKeyShare is\r\ngiven root access.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
